            <h2 class="h">About Us</h2>
            <h2 class="subtitle">Genuine Connections Like the ones back in school days</h2>
            <p class="p">Everyone is busy, everyone is on the clock. Our schedules are swamped up with uncountable deadlines because we want to enjoy our lives in the way we expected. Then where is the time for making stable meaningful connections and feeling a sense of belonging? There're plenty of social apps, parties, gartherings, networkings as we grow up, but that don't make us find resonance. It's either too business to be personal or too emotional to be stable. Other than family, only people with the same interests or hobbies in person makes the longest relationships. And why is that?</p>
            <p class="p">The key is in person company and mutual growth. Think back the time when you are in school, you have your best friendships because you are together days per week, sharing similar courses schedules, learning together and from each other. People say school time friendships are forever but they always end so soon. Yet, we still eager that types of companions even we are not in that time anymore. </p>
            <p class="p">So we build Skilland, through skills learning groups within local community, our users can learn the skills they want from their crew and also share the skills they have. From the journey of in person skillsharing, hopefully you can find companionships that worth your energy and vise versa.</p>
